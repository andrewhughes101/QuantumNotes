"Quantum computers are starting to approach the limit of classical simulation"

In quantum computing the basic variable that holds information is known as a *qubit*. Qubits un cannot
be represented like classical bits as they obey the laws of quantum mechanics.

We can visualise a single qubit using the *Bloch Sphere*, which is a geometrical representation. By using the two variables pheta and phi we can represent each possible qubit state as a point on the surface of a bloch sphere.

**Quantum Superposition** - When any two or more quantum states can be superposed
and the result is another valid quantum state

Quantum superposition can also be represented by the Schr√∂dinger equation

The complex conjugate is a complex number that has been reflected in the real axis (the real and imaginary parts are equal but the sign of the imaginary part reversed).
